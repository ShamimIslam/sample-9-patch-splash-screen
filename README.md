See [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) for license terms and conditions.



## Project Details ##

The 9-Patch Splash Screen app demonstrates how to use 9-patch PNG images for Android* splash screens within Intel速 XDK. 

This sample is part of the Intel速 XDK. 
Download the Intel速 XDK at [http://software.intel.com/en-us/html5](http://software.intel.com/en-us/html5). To see the technical details of the sample and for a 9-patch splash screen creation tutorial,

## Project File Information ##

The `icon.png` and `screenshot.png` files are not required by your project. They are included for use by the Intel速 XDK template/demo panel and have no use within a real app. You can safely delete them from your project directory.

The `cordova.js` script is needed to provide your app with access to Cordova APIs. To add Cordova APIs to your application you must add the corresponding Cordova plugins. See the Plugins section on the Projects tab.

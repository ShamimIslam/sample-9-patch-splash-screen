Project Details
---------------

The 9-Patch Splash Screen app demonstrates how to use 9-patch PNG images for
use as resizeable Android\* splash screens.

This sample is part of the Intel® XDK. Download the Intel® XDK at
[http://software.intel.com/en-us/html5](http://software.intel.com/en-
us/html5). To see the technical details of the sample, and for a 9-patch

Project File Information
------------------------

The `icon.png` and `screenshot.png` files are not required by your project.
They are included for use by the Intel® XDK template/demo panel and have no
use within a real app. You can safely delete them from your project folder.

The phantom `cordova.js` script reference in the `index.html` file is needed
to provide your app with access to Cordova APIs. To add Cordova APIs to your
application you must add the corresponding Cordova plugins. See the Plugins
section on the Projects tab.
